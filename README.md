Papagayo
========

Lipsync tool for animators




Papagayo 2.0b1
------------------------------------------------------------

This is a beta release of Papagayo - please excuse the lack of documentation.
(Documentation is provided for using the application, but not much about building it.)

Papagayo is a lip-sync application for animators. Please see the manual inside the
installer folder.

What you've downloaded here is the source code to Papagayo. You can modify and build it
as you wish, as long as you follow the terms in the License.txt file.

Papagayo is currently built as a Qt application. To build it you need Qt 5.15 installed.
I have built Papagayo for Windows, most likely will build for MacOS & Linux.

To build Papagayo, open up the file Papagayo.pro in Qt Creator and press the Build
Project button.

ADDENDUM

This is a 64 bit version, the 32 bit version will not compile probably.
This has a few extra phonemes meant for another project use them if needed.

More build tool setup may need to be done depending on your system.
There is a absolute path for one of the required libs, unknown as to why relative path didn't work
